# Hass.io Dropbox Uploader

This Hass.io add-on provides a simple way to upload your snapshots to Dropbox.

## Installation

Add this repository URL in Hass.io:

	https://github.com/d0ugal/hassio-dropbox-upload


## Configuration

### Dropbox

You will need to create a [Dropbox app](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps)

1. Choose `Dropbox API`
2. Either type of Dropbox app should work (Full or App directory)
3. Give it a unique name, this can be anything
4. Set the following scopes in the Permission tab (you need to do it *before* generating the token).
5. Click `Generate` under "Generated access token" and copy the token.


### All Configuration Options

## Automation

Here is the automation I use to create a snapshot and upload it to Dropbox.

```
  - alias: Backup Nightly
    trigger:
      platform: time
      at: '02:00:00'
    action:
      - service: hassio.snapshot_full
        data_template:
          name: Automated Backup {{ now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d') }}
          password: !secret snapshot_password
```


## Questions/Ideas

This project is young, and very light. I am interested in adding some features -
so long as it remains simple and easy to use. Please let me know of your ideas
and feedback!


## Making a release

`tox -e docker-build` and `tox -e docker-push` are probably the easiest way.

I tried setting up the github actions but failed. This works for now, good luck
future person trying to do this :)
